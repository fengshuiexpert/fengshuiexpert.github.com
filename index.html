<strong>You are a practicing psychotherapist and also a Feng Shui master. Two very different traditions. Are they compatible?</strong>
    &quot;When I pursued my doctorate in psychology, it was not long after I came to the US and I focused on learning the approaches of Western psychology. After I began my private practice as a therapist, I realized my own Chinese cultural traditions offered powerful tools for personal transformation. I've been able to integrate my training as a psychologist and a Feng Shui practitioner. I've found it enriches my practice both as a therapist and a Feng Shui consultant.&quot;</p>
<p>
<strong>What takes place during a Feng Shui consultation?</strong>
    &quot;I come to my clients' homes, offices or shops to conduct a consultation. I have my clients clarify their objectives for the consultation. For example, the most common objectives are creating harmonious energy, attracting abundance in life, cultivating healthy relationships and careers. Then I address the energy outside of the home. I see if the neighborhood buildings, roads or objects create negative energy towards the house or office. I move on to review the interior of the house or office, keeping the client's objectives in mind so that I don't have to work on every Feng Shui issue in the house. During the consultation, I educate my clients on how to identify good Chi and bad Chi, and I work with them to find personalized Feng Shui remedies that resonate with their energy to balance the undesirable Chi inside and outside the house. At the end I give follow-up instructions to my clients. I call it 'homework.' It can be practical activities, such as rearranging the home. Or it can be metaphysical, which involves ritual or symbolic manipulation of our relationship with non-ordinary reality. And sometimes the 'homework' borrows from my training as a counseling psychologist to work on personal or interpersonal transformation.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>How long is the typical Feng Shui consultation?</strong> &quot;For an apartment and a single person, an hour or two is sufficient to address the most immediate issues. For a couple or family in a larger home, it can be rewarding to spend three hours   or more to identify and remedy multiple issues. On occasion, I've spent all day assisting business people with real estate decisions or issues in a workplace. But an hour or two is enough for anyone to get started with improvements in their life.&quot;
</p>

<p><strong>What do people experience after a Feng Shui appointment?</strong> &quot;My immediate goal is for them to feel the calmness, serenity and peace that results from a good flow of Chi in the house or office. Sometimes that means improved productivity, greater ease in relationship, more harmonious family interaction or any other benefit that results from a reduction in conflict and tension in the immediate environment. I've had clients report that they've gotten a new job, gotten involved in a new relationship, or seen improvements in their success at work. Some of the stories are quite amazing to anyone who isn't familiar with Feng Shui.&quot;
</p>

<p><strong>What is the most significant benefit of a Feng Shui consultation?</strong> &quot;It brings change to your life. It reveals issues that are outside your awareness. And gives you help to initiate real improvement in your life.&quot;
</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for sharing your views! Are there any quick tips you can share?</strong> &quot;I can give you a few obvious ideas to give you a flavor for Feng Shui. But really, the tips you find in most Western books are quite simplistic. It's very different to work for several hours with a skilled Feng Shui practitioner.&quot;
